Simple algorithmic music synthesizes music and its waveforms with a minimal number of algorithms.
It doesn't use a database of waveforms or songs as resources, but synthesizes complex sound patterns with a minimal number of mathematical formulas and algorithms.
It's a type of music generation.
The music generated by this algorithm might be copyright free (or the algorithm may have copyrights)
